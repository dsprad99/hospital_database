# hospital_database
This hospital database is designed for a hospital with entities such as patients, nurses, physicians, nurses, health records, care records, etc. The overall idea of this project is to not only be able to query data that has been inserted into tables but to also be able to use triggers, views, transactions, etc. This overall helping the flow of the database to be more effecient and use "ACID" properties.
